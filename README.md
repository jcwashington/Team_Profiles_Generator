  # Team Profiles Generator

  [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-green)](http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

  ## Description
  This is a simple to use Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This is the user story:

  ```md
  AS A manager
  I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
  SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
  ```

  Technologies Utilized:
  Node, Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap 5, npm Inquirer and Jest packages.

  Challenges and Future Developement Opportunities:
  There were a lot of moving parts that led to a few hiccups. There are some things I'd like to improve, such as better handling of the sequence in which the user enters information.
